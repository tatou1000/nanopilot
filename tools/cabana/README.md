Cabana is a tool developed to view raw CAN data. One use for this is creating and editing [CAN Dictionaries](http://socialledge.com/sjsu/index.php/DBC_Format) (DBC files), and the tool provides direct integration with [commaai/opendbc](https://github.com/commaai/opendbc) (a collection of DBC files), allowing you to load the DBC files direct from source, and save to your fork. In addition, you can load routes from [comma connect](https://connect.comma.ai).
