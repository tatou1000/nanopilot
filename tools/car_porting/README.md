# tools/car_porting

Check out [this blog post](https://blog.comma.ai/how-to-write-a-car-port-for-openpilot/) for a high-level overview of porting a car.

## Useful car porting utilities

Testing car ports in your car is very time-consuming. Check out these utilities to do basic checks on your work before running it in your car.

### [Cabana](/tools/cabana/README.md)

View your car's CAN signals through DBC files, which openpilot uses to parse and create messages that talk to the car.

Example:
```bash
> tools/cabana/cabana '1bbe6bf2d62f58a8|2022-07-14--17-11-43'
```

### [tools/car_porting/auto_fingerprint.py](/tools/car_porting/auto_fingerprint.py)

Given a route and platform, automatically inserts FW fingerprints from the platform into the correct place in fingerprints.py

Example:
```bash
> python tools/car_porting/auto_fingerprint.py '1bbe6bf2d62f58a8|2022-07-14--17-11-43' 'SUBARU OUTBACK 6TH GEN'
Attempting to add fw version for:  SUBARU OUTBACK 6TH GEN
```

### [selfdrive/car/tests/test_car_interfaces.py](/selfdrive/car/tests/test_car_interfaces.py)

Finds common bugs for car interfaces, without even requiring a route.


#### Example: Typo in signal name
```bash
> pytest selfdrive/car/tests/test_car_interfaces.py -k subaru  # replace with the brand you are working on

=====================================================================
FAILED selfdrive/car/tests/test_car_interfaces.py::TestCarInterfaces::test_car_interfaces_165_SUBARU_LEGACY_7TH_GEN - KeyError: 'CruiseControlOOPS'

```

### [tools/car_porting/test_car_model.py](/tools/car_porting/test_car_model.py)

Given a route, runs most of the car interface to check for common errors like missing signals, blocked panda messages, and safety mismatches.

#### Example: panda safety mismatch for gasPressed
```bash
> python tools/car_porting/test_car_model.py '4822a427b188122a|2023-08-14--16-22-21'

=====================================================================
FAIL: test_panda_safety_carstate (__main__.CarModelTestCase.test_panda_safety_carstate)
Assert that panda safety matches openpilot's carState
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/batman/xx/openpilot/openpilot/selfdrive/car/tests/test_models.py", line 380, in test_panda_safety_carstate
    self.assertFalse(len(failed_checks), f"panda safety doesn't agree with openpilot: {failed_checks}")
AssertionError: 1 is not false : panda safety doesn't agree with openpilot: {'gasPressed': 116}
```

### [tools/car_porting/examples/subaru_steer_temp_fault.ipynb](/tools/car_porting/examples/subaru_steer_temp_fault.ipynb)

An example of searching through a database of segments for a specific condition, and plotting the results.

*a plot of the steer_warning vs steering angle, where we can see it is clearly caused by a large steering angle change*

### [tools/car_porting/examples/subaru_long_accel.ipynb](/tools/car_porting/examples/subaru_long_accel.ipynb)

An example of plotting the response of an actuator when it is active.

*a plot of the brake_pressure vs acceleration, where we can see it is a fairly linear response.*
