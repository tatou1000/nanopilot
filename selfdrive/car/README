In here lies the car abstraction layer, and is part of what you will implement to add a new car

== Car State ==

Implement the following minimal set of sensors:
  Speed -- best estimate of the speed of the car
  SteeringAngle -- current angle of the steering wheel
  ControlSurface -- gas position, brake position, steering torque

Implement the following optional sensors:
  RadarPoints -- Currently not optional, but could be with VOACC. Data from the radar of the car.
  WheelSpeeds -- The speed of the 4 wheels of the car. To be used for odometry

Implement the following controls:
  ControlSurface -- gas position (optional if PCM), brake position, steering torque

If you don't have a pedal interceptor and you use the PCM cruise control:
  CruiseState -- If system is enabled, and current set speed
  CruiseControl -- Commands to modify system speed and acceleration

== Car UI ==

I suspect many cars with ACC and LKAS have similar UIs

HUDControl

== Car Buttons ==

Uses an evented protocol

* Blinkers
* Cruise buttons
* Other buttons

== Car Errors ==

See capnp for list of errors
